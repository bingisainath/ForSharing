TCD Academic Year Structure https://www.tcd.ie/calendar/academic-year-structure/

- **How many hours of classes are there each week?**The M.Sc. programme entails approximately twenty contact hours per week (including lectures, tutorials, seminars, and laboratory classes) during the two teaching semesters. All modules require students to complete considerable further coursework and study in their own time beyond these timetabled hours.

- **How do I choose a dissertation topic?**Dissertation topics are suggested by the teaching staff who are active in the respective area of the MSc strands. Students are, of course, welcome, and indeed encouraged, to suggest topics of their own. Projects should in any case be self-contained and related to the strand topic. The goal is that the results of dissertation projects should be of a publishable standard (for examples of publications by previous students on our MSc degree programmes in the School, seeÂ [THIS LINK](https://publications.scss.tcd.ie/theses/diss/)) and could potentially be submitted to appropriate international conferences and journals on completion.
